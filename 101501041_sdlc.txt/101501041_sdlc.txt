How Importance of Learning DevOps Engineering in the Software Development Life Cycle

	The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process used to design, develop, test, and maintain software systems.
 Traditional SDLC models often separate development and operations teams, which can slow down software delivery and create communication challenges. DevOps engineering helps solve these problems by improving collaboration and automation throughout the development process.
 DevOps focuses on integrating development and operations teams to work together efficiently.
 By learning DevOps, engineers understand how to automate software building, testing, and deployment processes.
 Automation reduces human error and allows teams to deliver software updates faster and more reliably.
 Another important benefit of DevOps is continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD).
 These practices allow developers to test code frequently and deploy updates automatically.
 This improves software quality and helps organizations release new features quickly while maintaining system stability.
