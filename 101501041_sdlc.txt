Importance of Learning DevOps Engineering in the Software Development Life Cycle

	The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process used to design, develop, test, and maintain software systems.
 Traditional SDLC models often separate development and operations teams, which can slow down software delivery and create communication challenges.
 DevOps engineering helps solve these problems by improving collaboration and automation throughout the development process.
